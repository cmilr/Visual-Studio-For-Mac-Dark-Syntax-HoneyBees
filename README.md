# HoneyBees: Syntax Highlighting Theme for Xamarin Studio & Visual Studio for Mac
A colorful yet easy-on-the-eyes color scheme for Xamarin Studio & VS for Mac. I developed HoneyBees with
only one thing in mind — readability. I hope you find it helpful.

## Installation

Fork or download the repo, then load the HoneyBees.json file into your installation of Xamarin Studio or VS for Mac by navigating to Preferences > Syntax Highlighting, and using the Add function. That's it, you're good to go.

## Supports C#, XML, HTML, CSS

I've concentrated most of my efforts on developing a readable and attractive color scheme for C#, but I'm also quite happy with the XML highlighting.

That said, if you'd like to contribute, feel free to work-up the HTML or CSS sections—I've barely touched them and they could use a bit of love.

## VS Bugs

**Visual Studio for Mac** is currently running our theme a bit on the buggy side. It works, and it still looks good, but not as good as it should. **UPDATE:** the Visual Studio for Mac team has addressed this bug, and a fix is due in their next release. Stay tuned!
